# Open code in the NHS

## Introduction

There is a lot of literature in support of open coding in its various guises within the NHS and more generally across the public sector and academia.  This page is intended as a place to collate pertinent literature and proposed/tried approaches to implementation of open code policies in situations in the NHS from individual teams up to entire organisations.

There is also a significant crossover between open code and software engineering best practice, which means that they are often (always?) promoted together as an effective means to improve reproducibility,

There are a number of organisations and publications advocating open source as a default approach for software/analytics development within the NHS.
